## üîÑ Next Priority Tasks

1. **GORM Migration** - Dramatically simplify database code (1,300+ lines ‚Üí ~200 lines)
2. **Caching Strategy** - Implement intelligent caching for 90%+ performance improvement
3. **Progress Tracking** - Visual indicators for voting progress
4. **Enhanced Movie Cards** - Better UI and voting controls
5. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly interface
6. **Error Handling** - Better user feedback and error management

## üìù Notes

- **GORM Migration Priority**: High - This will dramatically simplify the codebase and improve maintainability
- **Caching Strategy**: Medium - Will significantly improve performance and reduce API costs
- **Database Scaling**: Medium - Important for production deployment
- **Performance**: High - Critical for user experience

## üéØ Current Focus

The next major milestone should be the **GORM Migration** as it will:

1. Reduce codebase from 1,300+ lines to ~200 lines
2. Eliminate manual SQL management
3. Add automatic schema migrations
4. Enable easy database switching
5. Improve type safety and maintainability
